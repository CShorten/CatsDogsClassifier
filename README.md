# CatsDogsClassifier
MATLAB project, transfer learning w/ alexnet + naive bayes classifier

This project uses transfer learning to extract features from the alexnet and repurpose them for a cat vs. dog classifier. Additional features of this project include being able to visualize the deeper layers of the network with the deepdreamimage() MATLAB function. The final classifiers are built with svm, decision tree, and naive bayes. The cat vs dogs dataset used to build this can be found on kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. Thank you for viewing!
